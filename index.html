                <h3>Step 1 Prepare the pizza dough</h3>
                <p>To prepare the pizza dough, start by combining all-purpose flour with salt and baking powder on a
                    kneading plate. Create a well in the center and add olive oil. Separately, activate yeast by mixing
                    it with warm water and sugar, allowing it to rise for 10-15 minutes. Combine the risen yeast with
                    the flour mixture, knead into a dough using water, and let it rest for 4-6 hours. Knead the dough
                    again before use, resulting in a ready-to-use pizza dough.</p>
                <h3>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base</h3>

                <p>
                    Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is
                    ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a
                    rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is
                    even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the
                    base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now,
                    your pizza base is ready.

                </p>
                <h3>
                    Step 3 Chop all the vegetables for the pizza
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of
                    it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However,
                    make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the
                    processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 4 Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h3>
                <p>
                    Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese
                    all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the veggies,
                    put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 5 Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celsius for 10 minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza bake 10 minutes at
                    250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and
                    chilli flakes as per your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated at 250
                    degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)

                <h3>Step 1 Prepare the pizza dough</h3>
                <p>To prepare the pizza dough, start by combining all-purpose flour with salt and baking powder on a
                    kneading plate. Create a well in the center and add olive oil. Separately, activate yeast by mixing
                    it with warm water and sugar, allowing it to rise for 10-15 minutes. Combine the risen yeast with
                    the flour mixture, knead into a dough using water, and let it rest for 4-6 hours. Knead the dough
                    again before use, resulting in a ready-to-use pizza dough.</p>
                <h3>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base</h3>

                <p>
                    Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is
                    ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a
                    rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is
                    even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the
                    base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now,
                    your pizza base is ready.

                </p>
                <h3>
                    Step 3 Chop all the vegetables for the pizza
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of
                    it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However,
                    make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the
                    processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 4 Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h3>
                <p>
                    Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese
                    all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the veggies,
                    put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 5 Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celsius for 10 minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza bake 10 minutes at
                    250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and
                    chilli flakes as per your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated at 250
                    degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)

                <h3>Step 1 Prepare the pizza dough</h3>
                <p>To prepare the pizza dough, start by combining all-purpose flour with salt and baking powder on a
                    kneading plate. Create a well in the center and add olive oil. Separately, activate yeast by mixing
                    it with warm water and sugar, allowing it to rise for 10-15 minutes. Combine the risen yeast with
                    the flour mixture, knead into a dough using water, and let it rest for 4-6 hours. Knead the dough
                    again before use, resulting in a ready-to-use pizza dough.</p>
                <h3>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base</h3>

                <p>
                    Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is
                    ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a
                    rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is
                    even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the
                    base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now,
                    your pizza base is ready.

                </p>
                <h3>
                    Step 3 Chop all the vegetables for the pizza
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of
                    it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However,
                    make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the
                    processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 4 Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h3>
                <p>
                    Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese
                    all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the veggies,
                    put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 5 Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celsius for 10 minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza bake 10 minutes at
                    250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and
                    chilli flakes as per your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated at 250
                    degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)
