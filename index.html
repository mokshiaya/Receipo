                        <h3>Step 1 Prepare the pizza dough</h3>
                        <p>To prepare the pizza dough, start by combining all-purpose flour with salt and baking powder
                            on a
                            kneading plate. Create a well in the center and add olive oil. Separately, activate yeast by
                            mixing
                            it with warm water and sugar, allowing it to rise for 10-15 minutes. Combine the risen yeast
                            with
                            the flour mixture, knead into a dough using water, and let it rest for 4-6 hours. Knead the
                            dough
                            again before use, resulting in a ready-to-use pizza dough.</p>
                        <h3>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base</h3>
                        <p>
                            Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the
                            dough
                            is
                            ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough.
                            Using
                            a
                            rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular
                            base
                            is
                            even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so
                            that
                            the
                            base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10
                            minutes.
                            Now,
                            your pizza base is ready.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Step 3 Chop all the vegetables for the pizza
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin
                            slices
                            of
                            it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner.
                            However,
                            make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now,
                            grate
                            the
                            processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 4 Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h3>
                        <p>
                            Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed
                            cheese
                            all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the
                            veggies,
                            put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 5 Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celsius for 10 minutes</h3>
                        <p>
                            Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza bake 10
                            minutes
                            at
                            250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle
                            oregano
                            and
                            chilli flakes as per your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated
                            at
                            250
                            degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)

                            start
                            to soften.
                            Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the sliced chicken breast to the empty
                            side.
                            Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes until it's no longer pink and starts to brown.

                            Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead to form a smooth and firm dough.

                            Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of each dough circle.
                            Fold the edges of the dough circle towards the center, pleating and sealing them to form a

                            Steam the momos over boiling water for 12-15 minutes or until the dough becomes translucent
                            and
                            cooked.
                            Remove the steamed momos from the steamer and keep them warm.

                            Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles.
                            Place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick
                            inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
                            The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on the cake after 25
                            minutes.
                            Once the cake is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
                            After cooling, gently run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen it from the pan.
                            Invert the cake onto a wire rack and let it cool completely before slicing and serving.
